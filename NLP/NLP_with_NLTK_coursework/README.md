# Natural language Processing with python 
this is a repo where I will be posting my learning on the book **Natural language Processing with python**
> The book is based on the Python programming language together with an open source
> library called the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

## What you will learn 
By digging into the material presented here, you will learn:
- How simple programs can help you manipulate and analyze language data, and how to write these programs
- How key concepts from NLP and linguistics are used to describe and analyze language
- How data structures and algorithms are used in NLP
- How language data is stored in standard formats, and how data can be used to evaluate the performance of NLP techniques
